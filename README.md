🚫 Tired of hundreds of spam page invites on Facebook?
I built a free Chrome extension that automatically declines all those page like invites — without risking your account.
## 🔧 How to Install

1. Download the ZIP file from this repo
2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer
3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Toggle **Developer mode** (top right)
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Select the folder you just extracted

You’ll now see the extension icon in your browser — go to your Facebook invites screen and click it!

## ✅ What It Does

- Clicks the “...” menu next to each invite
- Selects “Decline”
- Automatically confirms the pop-up
- Works with human-like delays to avoid account risk

### 🔐 License

This extension is open-source and provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

✅ You can:
- Download, use, and modify it freely
- Share it with others

⚠️ You’re responsible for how you use it — no warranties or guarantees. It clicks buttons on your behalf just like a human would, but you're responsible for your own account activity, especially if Facebook doesn't like it.
